<h3>Early Times</h3>
<p>Formula 1 formally came into existence in 1946 when it was defined by the the Fédération Internationale de
    l'Automobile (FIA), the world motor racing body, as the premier single seater racing category in racing car sport
    worldwide. The races were also known as Formula A. Most participating cars in early year competitions came from
    Italy.</p>

<h3>1950s</h3>
<p>1950 season included the inaugural Formula 1 world championship season. The championship included six Formula 1
races in Europe plus the Indianapolis 500. In the first modern Formula One race was held on 13th May, 1950 at
    Silverstone in England, Giuseppe Farino with his Alfa Romeo158 defeated legendary Argentinean Juan Manual Fangio,
    his nearest rival. However, it was Fangio, who dominated racing scene in the decade. Fangio won the title in
    1951, 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957. He is regarded the Grand Master of Formula One.

Stirling Moss of UK was a driver who competed regularly but was never able to win the race. He is widely considered
    the best driver ever never to win the race. The decade was dominated by teams run by road car manufacturers.</p>

<h3>1960s</h3>
<p>British drivers dominated in the Formula One races of 1960s. Colin Chapman's Team Lotus took the championship to new
standards in Formula One Racing. Jim Clark exploited his talent to the utmost and created history on his Lotus 33.

    switched to mid-engined cars. British teams and Commonwealth racers won twelve world championships between 1962 and 1973.</p>

<h3>1970s</h3>
<p>The 1970s saw the evolution of Formula One as a big commercial success. Bernie Ecclestone is credited with
     transforming the sport into the billion dollar business. On the racing track, Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi
    became the youngest driver to win the Grand Prix in Formula One History. However, Jack Stewart soon rose to
    challenge his supremacy. They together dominated the Formula 1 scene for the entire first half of the seventies.
    Biggest technological breakthrough in the decade was the introduction of aluminium sheet monocoque chassis in
    place of the traditional spaceframe design. Ground effect aerodynamics was introduced in late 1970s. The technological innovation greatly increased cornering speeds.</p>

<h3>1980s</h3>
<p>The early Eighties are known for the clashes between Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) and
     Formula One Constructors' Association (FOCA). The development of electronic driver aids also began in the 1980s.

    developed. On the track, this era was dominated by Nelson Piquet and McLaren. Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost also
    rose to fame.</p>

          1994. Michael Schumacher emerged as the next superstar. Schumacher, with Ferrari, won an unprecedented five
    consecutive drivers’ championships and six consecutive constructors’ championships between 1999 and 2004. Renault
    driver Fernando Alonso ended Schumacher's championship streak in September 2005. Currently, the world
    championships are dominated by manufacturer-owned teams like Renault, BMW, Toyota, Honda and Ferrari.</p>
