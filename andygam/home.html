<h2 align="center">Up for grabs: What’s still to play for in Abu Dhabi?</h2>
<p align="center"><b>Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes are 2017 world champions, but behind them there are
    still
    several
    key
    scores to be
    settled in Abu Dhabi this weekend – in both the drivers’ and the constructors’ standings, as well as between some
    rather evenly-matched team mates…</b></p><br>

<h3>Drivers: Runner-up spot - Vettel (302 points) vs Bottas (280)</h3>
<p class="article"><i>This one is far more open. With just seven points between them – and with both men more than
    capable
    of a podium finish – it could be a thrilling showdown between Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo
    and Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen. Of the two, only Raikkonen has won here before, but after the way Ricciardo came
    through the field in Brazil two weeks ago, the Australian is arguably
    favourite to maintain his lead over the Iceman.</i></p>

<h3>Constructors: Sixth place - Toro Rosso (53) vs Renault (49) vs Haas (47)</h3>
<p class="article"><i>This is the big one, with not just pride, but valuable prize money at stake. Mathematically, Toro Rosso could beat
    Williams to fifth overall, but realistically – given the latter’s 29-point advantage – that is not going to happen.
    The real battle is for sixth, with just six points covering the three teams involved. The formbook suggests Renault
    could sneak it – in the last three races they have scored seven points to Toro Rosso’s one and Haas’s four.
    With Carlos Sainz now firmly bedded in alongside Nico Hulkenberg (and with Pierre Gasly and Brendon Hartley still
    finding their F1 feet at Toro Rosso), the French squad will be the one to watch this weekend.</i></p>

<h3>Force India: Perez (7th, 94) vs Ocon (8th, 83)</h3>
<p class="article"><i>This has been arguably the tightest intra-team battle of 2017, with Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon coming together
    on more than one occasion – leading to team orders in the latter part of the season. However, with Force India
    having wrapped up fourth place in the constructors’ table, it’s gloves off once more this weekend. Perez secured
    a fourth place in Spain – if Ocon could match that in Abu Dhabi he could yet overhaul the more experienced
    Mexican.</i></p>
