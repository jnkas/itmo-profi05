        <h3>Drivers: Runner-up spot - Vettel (302 points) vs Bottas (280)</h3>
            <p> This one is far more open. With just seven points between them – and with both men
            more than capable of a podium finish – it could be a thrilling showdown between Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo
            and Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen. Of the two, only Raikkonen has won here before, but after the way Ricciardo came
            through the field in Brazil two weeks ago, the Australian is arguably
            favourite to maintain his lead over the Iceman.</p>

        <h3>Constructors: Sixth place - Toro Rosso (53) vs Renault (49) vs Haas (47)</h3>
            <p> This is the big one, with not just pride, but valuable prize money at stake. Mathematically, Toro Rosso
             could beat
            Williams to fifth overall, but realistically – given the latter’s 29-point advantage – that is not going to happen.
            With Carlos Sainz now firmly bedded in alongside Hulkenberg (and with Pierre Gasly and Brendon Hartley still
            finding their F1 feet at Toro Rosso), the French squad will be the one to watch this weekend.</p>

        <h3>Force India: Perez (7th, 94) vs Ocon (8th, 83)</h3>
            <p>This has been arguably the tightest intra-team battle of 2017, with Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon coming together
            on more than one occasion – leading to team orders in the latter part of the season. However, with Force India
            having wrapped up fourth place in the constructors’ table, it’s gloves off once more this weekend. Perez secured
            a fourth place in Spain – if Ocon could match that in Abu Dhabi he could yet overhaul the more experienced
            Mexican.</p>
